    "# GraphNeT Training Script (P-ONE, OM-center geometry) — Notes & Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this document to explain my training script end-to-end: what each part does, why I chose this graph representation, what SLURM resources I request, and what the “missing GCD / missing PMT positions” problem changes in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0) What I am trying to do\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to train a Graph Neural Network (GraphNeT) to predict **event energy** (`truth[\"energy\"]`) using detector pulse information stored in **Parquet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "My dataset limitation is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I do **not** have per-PMT positions.\n",
    "- I only have **Optical Module (OM) center** positions (`dom_x, dom_y, dom_z`).\n",
    "- Pulses have at least: OM-center position, time, charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I need a graph design that uses geometry but does not create “fake locality” inside a single OM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) High-level pipeline (what happens when I run the script)\n",
    "\n",
    "When I execute the script, this is the flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I define a **Detector mapping** (`PONE`) so GraphNeT knows how to interpret input columns.\n",
    "2. I define a **graph representation** (`KNNGraph`) with OM-level nodes using `ClusterSummaryFeatures`.\n",
    "3. I create a **ParquetDataset**, which loads events and builds one graph per event.\n",
    "4. I create a **DataLoader**, which batches graphs for training.\n",
    "5. I define a **GNN backbone** (`DynEdge`).\n",
    "6. I define a **task head** (`EnergyReconstruction`) to regress energy.\n",
    "7. I create a **StandardModel** from (data_representation + backbone + task).\n",
    "8. I train with `model.fit(...)` on GPU if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) The GCD / geometry problem in my dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 What I am missing\n",
    "Normally, a “good” detector geometry setup (GCD-like information) would let me place each PMT precisely inside an OM. But my dataset does not have that. Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All pulses from the same OM share the exact same `(dom_x, dom_y, dom_z)` (the OM center).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why pulse-level KNN is a problem here\n",
    "If I used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NodesAsPulses()` (node = pulse)\n",
    "- KNN edges based on `(dom_x, dom_y, dom_z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "then many pulses would be at identical coordinates (same OM center). That creates a failure mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a given pulse-node, the “closest K pulses” are often just other pulses from the **same OM** (distance 0).\n",
    "- So the graph ends up dominated by **within-OM** edges, not **between-OM** edges.\n",
    "- That reduces real spatial information flow across the detector and can confuse the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) My solution: OM-level nodes via clustering + KNN between OMs\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the “same OM pulse clique” problem, I switched node construction to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ClusterSummaryFeatures(cluster_on=[\"dom_x\", \"dom_y\", \"dom_z\"], ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One node per OM** (per event), created by clustering pulses that share the same OM-center position.\n",
    "- Node features become **summary statistics** of the pulses in that OM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I connect these OM nodes using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `KNNGraph(nb_nearest_neighbours=K, columns=[0,1,2])`\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each OM node, I connect it to its **K nearest neighboring OMs** in 3D geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fits my data limitation: I cannot resolve PMT micro-geometry, but I can still use OM spatial layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) What `ClusterSummaryFeatures` features mean (the ones I see in config)\n",
    "\n",
    "My `ClusterSummaryFeatures` configuration builds OM-level node features. Here is what each one means conceptually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Geometry identity\n",
    "Because I cluster on `dom_x, dom_y, dom_z`, every node starts with these as features:\n",
    "- `dom_x, dom_y, dom_z`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also used for KNN distance (I set `columns=[0,1,2]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Charge features\n",
    "#### `total_charge`\n",
    "- Sum of all pulse charges in that OM (a proxy for “how bright” that OM was in the event).\n",
    "- With `charge_standardization=\"log\"`, the feature is log10-scaled internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `charge_after_t` (e.g., `charge_after_10ns`, `charge_after_50ns`, `charge_after_100ns`)\n",
    "- “How much charge has accumulated within **t nanoseconds** after the reference time.”\n",
    "- These capture the *early vs late* charge buildup shape.\n",
    "- Also log10-scaled internally due to `charge_standardization=\"log\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Time features\n",
    "There is a reference time used internally (charge-weighted median time in the cluster), and some time features are expressed relative to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `time_of_first_hit`\n",
    "- Time of the first pulse in that OM (then shifted relative to the internal reference time).\n",
    "- Standardized with `time_standardization=0.001` (a multiplicative scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `time_spread`\n",
    "- “How wide is the pulse time distribution” inside the OM.\n",
    "- Roughly (last time − first time), depending on implementation.\n",
    "- Scaled by `0.001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `time_std`\n",
    "- Standard deviation of pulse times inside the OM.\n",
    "- Scaled by `0.001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `time_after_charge_pctX` (e.g., `time_after_charge_pct50`)\n",
    "- For a given percentile X, it measures:  \n",
    "  “How long until the OM accumulated **X% of its total charge**?”\n",
    "- This describes the temporal charge collection profile.\n",
    "- Scaled by `0.001`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Counts\n",
    "#### `add_counts=True` → `counts`\n",
    "- Adds the number of pulses in that OM cluster (pulse multiplicity).\n",
    "- This helps the model distinguish “few big pulses” vs “many small pulses,” etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Important standardization note (to avoid double transforms)\n",
    "Because `ClusterSummaryFeatures` already standardizes:\n",
    "- charge features (log10)\n",
    "- time features (multiply by 0.001)\n",
    "\n",
    "I keep my `PONE._charge()` and `PONE._time()` as identity (no extra log or scaling).  \n",
    "That avoids double-standardizing the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) Graph connectivity: what KNN means in my script\n",
    "\n",
    "I set:\n",
    "- `K = 8`\n",
    "- `columns = [0, 1, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the node feature vector begins with:\n",
    "- `[dom_x, dom_y, dom_z, ...]`\n",
    "\n",
    "So KNN distance uses exactly those geometry columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each OM node connects to its **8 nearest OM nodes** in 3D space.\n",
    "- This defines message-passing neighborhood size.\n",
    "- If I see memory issues or slow graph building, I can reduce K (e.g., 8 → 6 or 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Model architecture: DynEdge + EnergyReconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Backbone: `DynEdge`\n",
    "I use `DynEdge` as the GNN backbone. It performs message passing on the graph and produces an event-level representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I set:\n",
    "- `nb_inputs = data_representation.nb_outputs`  \n",
    "  So the backbone input dimension matches the OM-node feature dimension produced by `ClusterSummaryFeatures`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also set:\n",
    "- `global_pooling_schemes=[\"min\", \"max\", \"mean\"]`  \n",
    "  This means the model forms event-level features by pooling node embeddings using multiple aggregation operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Task head: `EnergyReconstruction`\n",
    "I use:\n",
    "- `EnergyReconstruction(target_labels=[\"energy\"])`\n",
    "- `LogCoshLoss()`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the model is trained as a regression model predicting event energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Training setup in my script\n",
    "\n",
    "I train with `StandardModel.fit(...)` using a **single GPU** (if CUDA is available).\n",
    "\n",
    "My key training choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epochs**\n",
    "  - `MAX_EPOCHS = 5`\n",
    "  - This is a short “baseline run” to confirm the full pipeline works end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU selection**\n",
    "  - `GPUS = 1 if torch.cuda.is_available() else None`\n",
    "  - If CUDA is available, training runs on 1 GPU (in my case, a MIG slice).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed strategy**\n",
    "  - `distribution_strategy=\"auto\"`\n",
    "  - This prevents PyTorch Lightning from trying to use notebook-incompatible DDP settings.\n",
    "  - Since I only have 1 GPU, I do **not** need DDP anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H100 performance tweak**\n",
    "  - I set:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    torch.set_float32_matmul_precision(\"medium\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - This can improve performance on H100 Tensor Cores (without changing my model code).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8) SLURM resources: what I request and why\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the model trains on **GPU**, I still need **CPU** for:\n",
    "- reading Parquet from disk,\n",
    "- clustering pulses into OM nodes (`ClusterSummaryFeatures`),\n",
    "- constructing KNN edges between OM nodes,\n",
    "- batching in the DataLoader.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I request too little CPU, the GPU will often **wait** for the next batch.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `--cpus-per-task=4`  \n",
    "  4 CPU cores for the process. I need CPU for the DataLoader + graph building even when training on GPU.  \n",
    "  This matches a stable baseline like `NUM_WORKERS=2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `--gpus-per-node=nvidia_h100_80gb_hbm3_1g.10gb:1`  \n",
    "  1 GPU allocation on the node, specifically an H100 MIG slice (1g.10gb), i.e. about ~10 GB VRAM.\n",
